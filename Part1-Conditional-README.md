# Part 1 - WuTangConcatenator
* Ensure 100% success in the each test class

* Create a class `WuTangConcatenator` which uses a composite `Integer` to identify divisibility.
    * Multiples of `3` are considered `Wu` numbers.
    * Multiples of `5` are considered `Tang` numbers.
    * Multiples of `3` and `5` are considered `WuTang` numbers.

* Create a class `BasicUtilities` which evaluates integers with relational operators.
    * `isGreaterThan5` should return `true` if the input is more than `5`, else false.
    * `isLessThan7` should return `true` if the input is less than `7`, else false.
    * `IsBetween5And7` should return `true` if the input is less than `7` and more than 5, else false.


* Create a class `IntegerArrayUtilities`
    * `hasEvenLength` should return `true` if the input array has an even length.
    * `range` should return an array of integers from `start` to `stop` inclusively.
